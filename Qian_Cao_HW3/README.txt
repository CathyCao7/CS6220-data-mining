The code file kmeans_hw.py is for the Question 5 in Homework 3.
You can simply run it in any Terminal you would like without any change. It is written in Python2.

After running, there will generate a png file which is the plot of cost function (mean SSE as a function of k) including error bars. And also print data for part b in the Question.
