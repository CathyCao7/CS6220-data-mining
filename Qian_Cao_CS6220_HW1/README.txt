Thanks for reading my codes!
Here are three parts of code for Homework 1. They have different ways to run in terminal:

	1.To run hw1_part1, you should input: python hw1_Part1.py [train_data_name].csv [test_data_name].csv

		like: python hw1_Part1.py train-1000-100.csv test-1000-100.csv

	2.To run hw1_part2, you should input: python hw1_Part2.py [train_data_name].csv [test_data_name].csv [lambdavalue]

		like: python hw1_Part2.py train-1000-100.csv test-1000-100.csv 1

	3.To run hw1_part3, you should input: python hw1_Part3.py [train_data_name].csv

		like: python hw1_Part3.py train-1000-100.csv


You can also copy each line as below:
Part 1:
	python hw1_Part1.py train-100-10.csv test-100-10.csv
	python hw1_Part1.py train-100-100.csv test-100-100.csv
	python hw1_Part1.py train-1000-100.csv test-1000-100.csv
	python hw1_Part1.py train-wine.csv test-wine.csv
	python hw1_Part1.py train-50of1000-100.csv test-1000-100.csv
	python hw1_Part1.py train-100of1000-100.csv test-1000-100.csv
	python hw1_Part1.py train-150of1000-100.csv test-1000-100.csv
Part 3:
	python hw1_Part3.py train-100-10.csv
	python hw1_Part3.py train-100-100.csv
	python hw1_Part3.py train-1000-100.csv
	python hw1_Part3.py train-wine.csv
	python hw1_Part3.py train-50of1000-100.csv
	python hw1_Part3.py train-100of1000-100.csv
	python hw1_Part3.py train-150of1000-100.csv

The version I use is Python3 and have run the code on Mac OS X successfully.
