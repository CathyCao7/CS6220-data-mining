For Homework 2, here are three code files (written in Python3) for part 2:
	hw2_knn_A.py, hw2_knn_B.py, hw2_knn_C.py

Each of them can directly get the result for different needs in (a), (b) and (c). They look the same and just have a little change in the code.

There is an additional code for decision tree (which is no need for homework 2). And also another README in the folder: dt_additioncode
