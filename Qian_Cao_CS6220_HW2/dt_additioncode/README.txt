The code in this part is written in Python2.
To run the code in the terminal, you need to input: python main.py
And then there will create a new python code file called program.py
The decision Tree will be shown in the file! 
Like:
tree = {'Education Level': {'High School': {'Years of Experience': {'More than 10': {'Career': {'Management': 'High', 'Service': 'Low'}}, 'Less than 3': 'Low', '3 to 10': 'Low'}}, 'College': {'Location': {'California': 'High', 'Oregon': 'Low'}}}}

If you have some test data to predict labels, just save them in the Salary.csv (which I use here is just the same as training data) and then run program.py
